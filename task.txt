


We have to design a URL shortener service that takes a valid url and returns a shortened URL, redirecting the user to the previously provided URL.


Also we keep tracks of total visits/clocks on the URL.

Routes

POST/URL-Generates a new short URL: and returns the shortened URL in the format example.com/random-id

GET/:id - Redirects the user to the original URL
GET/URL/analytics/:id -Returns the clicks for the provided short id
